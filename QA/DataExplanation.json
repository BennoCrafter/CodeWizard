It can take any number of arguments, but can only have one expression.\nLambda functions are often used as a shortcut for a function that is only used once, or as a way to pass a function as an argument to another function.\nA lambda function is a small anonymous function in Python. It can take any number of arguments, but can only have one expression.\n\nHere is an example of a simple lambda function that adds two numbers:\n\nadd = lambda x, y: x + y\nresult = add(3, 4)\nprint(result)  # Output: 7\nThis lambda function takes two arguments, x and y, and returns their sum. You can call the lambda function just like any other function, by using parentheses and passing in the arguments.",
